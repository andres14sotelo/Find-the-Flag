# Find-the-Flag

This project is from Codecademy. The objective of this project is classify which continent of each nation's flag belong in. I built a Decision Tree model perform this classification technique. The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which has 194 rows and 30 columns. I selected a handful of columns to use for my decision tree which resulted with the highest score of 55% accuracy rate. It may not be the highest, it would depend on the variables you choose and how you tune your parameters.
